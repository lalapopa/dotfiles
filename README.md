# dotfiles

4 you If you forget what desktop and main branches are:

`desktop` --- is old PC that was on Pop OS and now this is like home
server/home lab.
`main` --- was old setup that uses i3 as wm and so many cool stuff 

## In future when you have another spare laptop

Make homelab dotfiles and laptop dotfiles that can be used as desktop.

Im using Windows from 2024 :(
